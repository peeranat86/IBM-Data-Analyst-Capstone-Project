# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

Welcome to the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project repository. This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and visualization techniques acquired through the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program. The focus is on analyzing job market trends to identify in-demand programming skills.

## 📁 Project Overview

In this capstone project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst at a global IT and business consulting firm. The objective was to collect and analyze data from various sources to identify emerging programming skills in demand. The project encompasses:

- Data collection from APIs and web scraping.
- Data wrangling and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Data visualization.
- Dashboard creation using IBM Cognos Analytics.
- Presentation of findings.

## 📊 Dataset

The datasets utilized in this project were obtained through:

- **APIs**: Collected job postings data using APIs from platforms such as GitHub Jobs.
- **Web Scraping**: Extracted data from relevant websites to gather information on programming languages and job trends.

The collected data includes details such as job titles, required skills, company information, and job locations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup, Requests
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, IBM Cognos Analytics
- **Databases**: SQLite
- **Others**: APIs for data collection, Web scraping techniques

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **Data Collection**: Implemented scripts to fetch data from APIs and perform web scraping to gather relevant job market information.
- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaned and transformed the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted EDA to uncover patterns and trends in the job market data.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visual representations of the data to facilitate better understanding of the insights.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Developed an interactive dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics to present the findings.
- **Presentation**: Compiled the analysis and insights into a comprehensive presentation.
